# Change Log API

Welcome to the Change Log API! This API is designed to track and manage changes made to an organization's systems and processes. It is an open source project, so feel free to use and modify the code as needed.

## Features
- Track changes made to systems and processes
- View a history of changes
- View details on specific changes, including the date and time of the change, the user who made the change, and a description of the change
- Filter changes by date, user, and type of change

## How to use
To use the Change Log API, simply make a GET request to the API endpoint with the desired parameters. For example:

`GET https://api.changelog-hrdev.com/changes?start_date=2022-01-01&end_date=2022-12-31`

This request will retrieve all changes made within the specified date range. Additional parameters, such as `user` and `change_type`, can also be included to further filter the results.
